Sshconf is a library for reading and modifying your ssh/config file in a non-intrusive way, meaning
your file should look more or less the same after modifications. Idea is to keep it simple,
so you can modify it for your needs.

Installation and usage
---------------------------

Install through pip is the most easy way. You can install from the Git source directly:

```bash
pip install sshconf
```

Below is some example use:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
from sshconf import read_ssh_config, empty_ssh_config_file
from os.path import expanduser

c = read_ssh_config(expanduser("~/.ssh/config"))
print("hosts", c.hosts())

# assuming you have a host "svu"
print("svu host", c.host("svu"))  # print the settings
c.set("svu", Hostname="ssh.svu.local", Port=1234)
print("svu host now", c.host("svu"))
c.unset("svu", "port")
print("svu host now", c.host("svu"))

c.add("newsvu", Hostname="ssh-new.svu.local", Port=22, User="stud1234")
print("newsvu", c.host("newsvu"))

c.rename("newsvu", "svu-new")
print("svu-new", c.host("svu-new"))

# overwrite existing file(s)
c.save()

# write all to a new file
c.write(expanduser("~/.ssh/newconfig"))

# creating a new config file.
c2 = empty_ssh_config_file()
c2.add("svu", Hostname="ssh.svu.local", User="teachmca", Port=22)
c2.write("newconfig")

c2.remove("svu")  # remove
```

A few things to note:
- `save()` overwrites the files you read from.
- `write()` writes a new config file. If you used `Include` in the read configuration, output will contain everything in one file.
- indent for new lines is auto-probed from existing config lines, and defaults to two spaces.
